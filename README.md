- 👋 Hi, I’m @jjlancaster
- 👀 I’m interested in coding an application that combines a triple-store RDF database with a semantic search query (python? JS?), 
- for which the query returns URLS that are scraped for content in an NLP step and a new set of SUBJECT-PREDICATE-OBJECT entries are stored in a
- graph database on my server, and then to create a visual representation of a subset of that graph.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, Python, Git, React, TensorFlow and other tools
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anythin related to the above effort
- 📫 How to reach me: dr.justin.lancaster@gmail.com , or http://linkedin.com/in/justinlancaster
